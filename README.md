# Black-Scholes-Merton Options Pricing Calculator with Heatmaps

This project is an interactive **Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) Options Pricing Calculator** built using **Streamlit**. The application provides intuitive visualizations and insights into options pricing and profit & loss (P&L) scenarios.

## Features

### Call & Put Price Calculation
* Computes the theoretical prices of European call and put options based on the user-provided inputs:
  * **Stock Price (S₀)**
  * **Strike Price (K)**
  * **Time to Maturity (T)**
  * **Volatility (σ)**
  * **Risk-Free Interest Rate (r)**

### Call & Put Options Heatmaps
* Visualizes how the option prices vary with changes in:
  * **Volatility (σ)**
  * **Asset Price (S₀)**

### Profit & Loss (P&L) Heatmaps
* Displays the profit or loss for call and put options based on:
  * **User-defined purchase prices for the options.**
  * Positive values (**profits**) are highlighted in **green**, while negative values (**losses**) are shown in **red**.

### Interactive Inputs
* Users can customize parameters using sliders and input fields.
* Adjustable grid resolution for heatmaps (number of steps).

### Exportable Data
* Option to download heatmap data as CSV files for further analysis.

## How It Works

### Black-Scholes-Merton Model
* The app uses the **BSM formula** to calculate the theoretical prices of European options.
* Heatmaps are generated by varying the stock price and volatility across user-defined ranges.

### Profit & Loss (P&L) Calculation
* The app computes the difference between the theoretical option price and the user-defined purchase price.
* Separate heatmaps visualize the resulting **P&L** for calls and puts.
